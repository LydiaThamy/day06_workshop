Accept the condition as it is & accept the responsibility to change them.
Perfection is not attained in a day; it is a process that takes daily effort.
Taking a genuine interest in little details of life is a form of true happiness.
Happiness is a journey and not a destination.
No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.
Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you.
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate.
The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection.
I am careful not to confuse excellence with perfection. Excellence I can reach for; perfection is Godâ€™s business.
The true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life.
